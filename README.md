# 3D Selfie 3D-me

I went in for a body scan to 3D-print a miniature model of myself. I uploaded the 3D object and run it in the browser using three.js

# [Demo](https://briansunter.github.io/3D-me/ "Demo")

A new store opened up in the Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco called [Pocket Me](http://www.pocketme.com "Pocket Me"). This store promised to 3D-print a realistic miniature figurine of anything. I was equally interested in getting a high quality 3d object file for use in the browser and in games. It looks like a mini action figure.
